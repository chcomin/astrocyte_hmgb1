## Code for Astroglial *Hmgb1* regulates postnatal astrocyte morphogenesis and cerebrovascular maturation


This repository contains the code for the manuscript **Astroglial *Hmgb1* regulates postnatal astrocyte morphogenesis and cerebrovascular maturation**, from Andrade et al. The code is organized as Jupyter notebooks. 

The organization of the code follows the block diagram shown in section **Automated analysis of immunofluorescence images** of the methods section of the paper. The diagram has six steps: (a1), (a2), (b), (c), (d) and (e). At the beginning each notebook there is a reference to the step that the code implements.
